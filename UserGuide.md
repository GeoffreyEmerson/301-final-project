# Convoke!

Welcome to Convoke! An app the gives you the power to quickly and intuitively organize your get-togethers with friends, or any other kind of short notice casual gathering.

Using Convoke is designed to be as fast and simple as possible. You don't even need a password! We're all friends here!

The two main organization areas that Convoke! will help you with are scheduling and topic preferences. When your guests visit your event page, they can let the app know when their best availability times are, and when they are unavailable, just by clicking on boxes in the Availability Viewer. The app will then assemble a heat map that gives you an at-a-glance view of when most people are available to meet.

You can also set up Preference Finder topics. What do your guests want to eat? What activity does everybody want to do? Your guests can suggest options, and click to approve or disapprove of options that other people have suggested. After a few people have made suggestions, Convoke! will build a word cloud showing what everybody agrees on most prominently.

As the Event Organizer, here are the steps to get started:

1. Start on the main page: (TODO: root URL goes here)
1. Click on the "New Event" button.
1. Enter your name. If this is not your first time using the app, Convoke may remember you!
1. You will now be looking at your event's main admin view.

You have lots of options from here!
- You can suggest times on your Availability Viewer, and/or eliminate times that you know are not possible.
- You can set up Preference Finder topics. What does everybody want to eat? Kid friendly or grown-ups only? If you're meeting to see a movie, which movie? If you're meeting to play a board game, which game?
- You can set the meeting location. (Or put that up for discussion as a Preference Finder topic!)
- And finally, whether you've put lots of thought into planning your gathering ahead of time or none at all, you can copy the link from the "Event Link" box and send it to your friends!

Your guests will be able to see most of the same things you see on your main event page. They will be able to set their availability in the Availability Viewer, click on Preference Finder suggestions to vote on them, and suggest new options. And if they can't come, they have the option of setting themselves as "Not Attending".

All the results from your friends' responses build up on the main event page in real time! You will be able to see who has responded, and the building consensus as suggestions are made and choices are clicked!

Oh, and as the Event Organizer, you have veto power! If somebody makes a suggestion that you are completely opposed to, you can remove it from consideration by clicking on the 'x' that appears when you hover over it. Don't let the power go to your head! We're all friends here!
